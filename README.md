# fligoo-takehome

Here is my final version of the takehome, you can find the package versions in the requirements.txt file.

The main file is the `fligoo_take_home_data_scientist_semi_senior.ipynb`, that file imports the `create_pipeline` function from `pipelines.py`, `transformers.py` contains transformer class definitions used in the `pipelines.py`.

Everything is put together so the notebook can be run without looking at the other files, if any problem arises please feel free to contact me.
